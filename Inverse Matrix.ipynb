    "# Inverse matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "An inverse matrix is a matrix that, when multiplied by a given square matrix, *yields the identity matrix*. Here’s a detailed overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "For a square matrix $A$, its inverse is denoted as $A^{-1}$. The relationship is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A \\cdot A^{-1} = A^{-1} \\cdot A = I$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I$ is the [[I - Identity Matrix]] of the same size as $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditions for Inverses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Square Matrix**: Only square matrices (same number of rows and columns) can have inverses.\n",
    "2. **Invertibility**: A matrix $A$ is invertible (or non-singular) if there exists a matrix $A^{-1}$ such that the above condition holds. If no such matrix exists, $A$ is called singular.\n",
    "3. **Determinant**: For a matrix to be invertible, its determinant must be non-zero. If the determinant of $A$ (denoted as $\\text{det}(A)$ is zero, the matrix does not have an inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Find the Inverse\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods to find the inverse of a matrix, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gauss-Jordan Elimination**: You can augment the matrix $A$ with the identity matrix $I$ and use row operations to transform $A$ into III. The resulting matrix on the right will be $A^{-1}$.\n",
    "2. **Adjugate and Determinant Method**: For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The inverse is given by:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{ad - bc} \\begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    provided ad-bc != 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "\tThe determinant of a $3 \\times 3$ matrix $E = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{pmatrix}$​​ is calculated as:\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t$\\text{det}(E) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Inverse Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unique**: If a matrix has an inverse, it is unique.\n",
    "2. **Inverse of a Product**: The inverse of a product of two matrices is the product of their inverses in reverse order:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}$\n",
    "3. **Inverse of the Inverse**: The inverse of an inverse matrix is the original matrix:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $(A^{-1})^{-1} = A$\n",
    "4. **Transpose**: The inverse of the transpose of a matrix is equal to the transpose of the inverse:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $(A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T$\n"

    "# Identity Matrix \n",
    "The identity matrix is a special type of square matrix that plays a crucial role in linear algebra. Here are the key characteristics and meanings of the identity matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Square Matrix**: The identity matrix is always a square matrix, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns.\n",
    "2. **Diagonal Elements**: The elements on the main diagonal (from the top left to the bottom right) are all 1s.\n",
    "3. **Off-Diagonal Elements**: All other elements (those not on the diagonal) are 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "The identity matrix of size $n\\times n$ is often denoted as $I_n$​. For example, the identity matrix of size #2 \\times 2# is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$I_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "And for size $3 \\times 3$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$I_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Leading value of Identity matrix is always 1* (row echelon form)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiplicative Identity**: The identity matrix acts as the multiplicative identity in matrix multiplication. For any matrix $A$ of compatible size:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $A \\cdot I = I \\cdot A = A$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This means that multiplying any matrix by the identity matrix does not change the matrix.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Inverses**: If a matrix $A$ has an inverse $A^{-1}$, then:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $A \\cdot A^{-1} = I$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This property is essential for solving systems of equations and understanding linear transformations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Linear Transformations**: In the context of linear transformations, the identity matrix represents the transformation that leaves vectors unchanged. For example, applying the transformation represented by $I$ to any vector $\\mathbf{v}$ results in $\\mathbf{v}$.\n"

    "# Transpose of a Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The **transpose of a matrix** is an operation that flips the matrix over its diagonal, turning the rows of the original matrix into columns and the columns into rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a matrix $A$, the transpose of $A$ is denoted as $A^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the original matrix $A$ is:\n",
    "$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The transpose ATA^TAT would be:\n",
    "$$A^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 5 \\\\ 3 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}$$​​\n",
    "So, in the transpose:\n",
    "- The first row of $A$ becomes the first column of $A^T$.\n",
    "- The second row of $A$ becomes the second column of $A^T$, and so on.\n",
